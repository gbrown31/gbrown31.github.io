## Adventures in Code

Hello! I decided to try out GitHub pages, played around little with Jekyll and GitHub Actions before settling down with MkDocs. I'm not looking for overly fancy design or visuals so [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) perfect for me.

## Introduction

Hello again, my name is Gary. I decided to start making more use of the incredible advances in tooling and technology to document and share code. As I've never published a blob or written about code it is a bit of an adventure, hence the name Adventures in Code.
