# Leet Code

One day I happened to see a tweet from David Fowler about Leet Code and signed up to the site. It had been a few years since I had looked at Data Structures & Algorithm questions so found it incredibly tough to make any progress beyond the basic array manipulation questions.

I've been dabbling in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for almost one year now, on and off, not constantly but often enough to ensure I don't completely forget everthing. You can view [my profile](https://leetcode.com/gbrown31/) and view my incredible rank of 468,935. I have no idea if that is any good as I haven't taken up the competitive side of the platform at all. It would be nice if the ranking had some context... I mean there could only be 500,000 users of the site or is this my rank in the global population... who knows?


## Going Premium

Infuriating by how poorly I was performing I signed up for a LeetCode premium subscription and started on the data structure and algorithms crash course. After a few weeks I was able to complete most of the easy and medium challenges. The hard ones are still hard, where the algorithm(s) required can be wrapped in one or more puzzles.

Getting used to coding without an IDE was also challenging; remembering classes and their uses without intellisense was more challenging. It did get easier with practice but once I was over the initial challenge of not using an IDE I did want to be able to debug and write my own tests. For some of the problems I started coding solutions locally rather than in the browser, which led to this [repo](https://github.com/gbrown31/LeetCode.Problems) of problems & solutions.


## Custom Data Structures

As part of a now archived course on [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) there was a recommendation to create your own data structure implementations so that you would better understand how they worked. This did actually help me and the code is avaliable [here](https://github.com/gbrown31/DataStructures.Custom) if you need help getting to sleep.
